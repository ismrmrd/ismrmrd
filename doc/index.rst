ISMRM Raw Data Format (ISMRMRD)
################################

A prerequisite for sharing magnetic resonance (imaging) reconstruction algorithms and code is a common raw data format. The ISMRMRD project describes such a common raw data format, which attempts to capture the data fields that are required to describe the magnetic resonance experiment with enough detail to reconstruct images. The repository also contains a C/C++ library for working with the format. This standard was developed by a subcommittee of the ISMRM Sedona 2013 workshop and is described in detail in:
